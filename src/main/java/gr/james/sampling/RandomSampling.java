/**
 * Represents a reservoir sampling algorithm.
 * <p>
 * A reservoir sampling algorithm randomly chooses a sample of {@code k} items from a list {@code S} containing
 * {@code n} items, where {@code n} may be unknown. A sampling algorithm may support weighted elements, in which case it
 * is considered a weighted random sampling algorithm and implements {@link WeightedRandomSampling}, which is a
 * subinterface of {@code RandomSampling}.
 * <p>
 * All classes implementing {@code RandomSampling} have equivalent behavior in terms of the first-order inclusion
 * probabilities of the elements but not necessarily in terms of higher-order probabilities (which is relevant for
 * {@code k > 1}). They are also differentiated only on performance characteristics.
 * <p>
 * A {@code RandomSampling} algorithm does not keep track of duplicate elements because that would result in a linear
 * memory complexity. Thus, it is valid to feed the same element multiple times in the same instance. For example it is
 * possible to feed both {@code x} and {@code y}, where {@code x.equals(y)}. The algorithm will treat these items as
 * distinct, even if they are reference-equals ({@code x == y}). As a result, the final sample {@link Collection} may
 * contain duplicate elements. Furthermore, elements need not be immutable and the sampling process does not rely on the
 * elements' {@code hashCode()} and {@code equals()} methods.
 * <p>
 * Implementations can throw {@link StreamOverflowException} if some overflow has occurred in the internal state of the
 * algorithm that would otherwise prevent it from functioning properly, typically related to the stream size.
 * <p>
 * Classes that implement this interface have a static method with signature
 * <pre><code>
 * public static &lt;E&gt; RandomSamplingCollector&lt;E&gt; collector(int sampleSize, Random random)
 * </code></pre>
 * that returns a {@link RandomSamplingCollector} to use with the Java 8 stream API.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface have constant space complexity in respect to the stream size.
